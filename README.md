### Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that alternates between working sessions and breaks which allows for high effiency when working. Typically, sessions are 25 minutes and breaks are 5 minutes, but this technique works best when tailored to your own personal working style. 

To read more about the technique, I suggest [this article](https://www.themuse.com/advice/take-it-from-someone-who-hates-productivity-hacksthe-pomodoro-technique-actually-works).

I also suggest [Abao in Tokyo's](https://www.youtube.com/@abaointokyo) Youtube Channel, where you can follow the Pomodoro Technique with someone else. I personally watch their videos from time to time as well.
